# Learn C

C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.

C has been standardized since 1989 by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and, subsequently, jointly by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

## Why Learn C?
 - It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
 - If you know C, you will have no problem learning other popular programming languages such as Java, Python, C++, C#, etc, as the syntax is similar
 - C is very fast, compared to other programming languages, like Java and Python
 - C is very powerful; it has been used to develop operating systems, databases, applications, etc

## My Experience
My programming journey began three years ago with C. 
This foundational language offers a level of control and detail that fosters a deep understanding of how code interacts with the underlying system.
This experience has proven invaluable, providing a strong base for learning more complex languages.<br>

My experience with C programming has been rewarding, I started by learning the fundamentals like data types, operators, and control flow statements.
This experience helped me solidify my understanding of memory management and pointers.
Also, C has provided me with a strong foundation in programming concepts that have been valuable as I've learned other languages.
